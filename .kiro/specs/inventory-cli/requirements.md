# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a command-line interface (CLI) to the mbx-inventory package using typer, allowing users to sync inventory data from various backends (AirTable, Baserow, NocoDB) to a PostgreSQL database. The CLI will provide an interactive experience for configuring and managing inventory synchronization operations, similar to the existing mbx-db CLI pattern.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure inventory synchronization settings through a configuration file, so that I can specify which backend to use and connection details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides an inventory_config.json file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the configuration
2. IF the configuration file is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
3. WHEN the configuration is valid THEN the system SHALL store the settings for subsequent operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate my inventory backend connection, so that I can ensure the configuration is correct before attempting synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the validate command THEN the system SHALL test connectivity to the configured backend
2. IF the backend connection fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error details
3. WHEN the backend connection succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm successful validation
4. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL check that all required tables exist in the backend

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to sync inventory data from my backend to PostgreSQL, so that I can have a local copy of the inventory data for analysis and operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the sync command THEN the system SHALL retrieve data from all configured inventory tables
2. WHEN syncing data THEN the system SHALL transform backend data to match the PostgreSQL schema
3. IF records already exist in PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL update them with new data
4. IF records don't exist in PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL create new records
5. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of created/updated records
6. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and rollback partial changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to preview what changes will be made during sync, so that I can review the impact before committing changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs sync with --dry-run flag THEN the system SHALL show what changes would be made without executing them
2. WHEN in dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL display counts of records that would be created/updated/deleted
3. WHEN in dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL show sample records that would be affected
4. WHEN in dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL not modify the PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to sync specific tables only, so that I can control which inventory data gets synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user specifies --tables parameter THEN the system SHALL only sync the specified tables
2. WHEN no tables are specified THEN the system SHALL sync all configured tables
3. IF a specified table doesn't exist in the backend THEN the system SHALL display an error and continue with other tables
4. WHEN syncing specific tables THEN the system SHALL respect table dependencies and sync in correct order

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging during sync operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync operations run THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators
2. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show detailed operation logs
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log specific error details with context
4. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive summary report
