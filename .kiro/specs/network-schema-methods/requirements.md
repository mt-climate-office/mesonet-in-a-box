# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing generalizable inventory manager in mbx-inventory to include specialized methods for retrieving network schema data from inventory backends (AirTable, Baserow, etc.) that correspond to the mbx-db network schema tables. While the current inventory manager provides generic CRUD operations, this enhancement adds domain-specific methods that can read structured data from inventory systems and prepare it for synchronization with the network database schema.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing inventory data, I want specialized methods to retrieve elements data from my inventory backend, so that I can populate the network.elements table in my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call get_elements() THEN the system SHALL return all elements from the inventory backend's elements table
2. WHEN I call get_elements() with filters THEN the system SHALL return filtered elements from the inventory backend based on the provided criteria
3. WHEN elements data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return data in a format compatible with the network.elements schema
4. WHEN the inventory backend contains elements data THEN the system SHALL map backend fields to the expected database schema fields (element, description, description_short, si_units, us_units, extra_data)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing inventory data, I want specialized methods to retrieve component model data from my inventory backend, so that I can populate the network.component_models table in my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call get_component_models() THEN the system SHALL return all component models from the inventory backend's component models table
2. WHEN I call get_component_models() with manufacturer filter THEN the system SHALL return only models from the specified manufacturer from the inventory backend
3. WHEN component model data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return data in a format compatible with the network.component_models schema
4. WHEN the inventory backend contains component model data THEN the system SHALL map backend fields to the expected database schema fields (model, manufacturer, type)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing inventory data, I want specialized methods to retrieve station information from my inventory backend, so that I can populate the network.stations table in my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call get_stations() THEN the system SHALL return all stations from the inventory backend's stations table
2. WHEN I call get_stations() with status filter THEN the system SHALL return only stations with the specified status from the inventory backend
3. WHEN station data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return data in a format compatible with the network.stations schema
4. WHEN the inventory backend contains station data THEN the system SHALL map backend fields to the expected database schema fields (station, name, status, date_installed, latitude, longitude, elevation)
5. WHEN station status values exist in the inventory backend THEN the system SHALL validate they match allowed values ('pending', 'active', 'decommissioned', 'inactive')

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing inventory data, I want specialized methods to retrieve inventory items from my inventory backend, so that I can populate the network.inventory table in my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call get_inventory() THEN the system SHALL return all inventory items from the inventory backend's inventory table
2. WHEN I call get_inventory() with model filter THEN the system SHALL return all inventory items of the specified model from the inventory backend
3. WHEN inventory data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return data in a format compatible with the network.inventory schema
4. WHEN the inventory backend contains inventory data THEN the system SHALL map backend fields to the expected database schema fields (model, serial_number, extra_data)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing inventory data, I want specialized methods to retrieve deployment data from my inventory backend, so that I can populate the network.deployments table in my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call get_deployments() THEN the system SHALL return all deployments from the inventory backend's deployments table
2. WHEN I call get_deployments() with station filter THEN the system SHALL return all deployments for the specified station from the inventory backend
3. WHEN deployment data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return data in a format compatible with the network.deployments schema
4. WHEN the inventory backend contains deployment data THEN the system SHALL map backend fields to the expected database schema fields (station, model, serial_number, date_assigned, date_start, date_end, extra_data, elevation_cm)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing inventory data, I want specialized methods to retrieve component-element mappings from my inventory backend, so that I can populate the network.component_elements table in my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call get_component_elements() THEN the system SHALL return all component-element relationships from the inventory backend's component elements table
2. WHEN I call get_component_elements() with model filter THEN the system SHALL return all elements associated with the specified component model from the inventory backend
3. WHEN component-element data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return data in a format compatible with the network.component_elements schema
4. WHEN the inventory backend contains component-element data THEN the system SHALL map backend fields to the expected database schema fields (model, element, qc_values)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing inventory data, I want specialized methods to retrieve schema data from my inventory backend, so that I can populate the network schema tables for request and response schemas in my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call get_request_schemas() THEN the system SHALL return all request schemas from the inventory backend's request schemas table
2. WHEN I call get_response_schemas() THEN the system SHALL return all response schemas from the inventory backend's response schemas table
3. WHEN schema data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return data in a format compatible with the network.request_schemas and network.response_schemas schemas
4. WHEN the inventory backend contains schema data THEN the system SHALL map backend fields to the expected database schema fields (network/response_name, request_model/response_model)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer using the inventory manager, I want the new network schema methods to integrate seamlessly with the existing CRUD interface, so that I can use both generic and specialized methods to read from my inventory backends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an Inventory instance with a backend THEN the system SHALL provide access to both generic CRUD methods and specialized network schema methods
2. WHEN I call specialized network schema methods THEN the system SHALL use the same backend connection as the generic CRUD methods
3. WHEN backend validation fails THEN both generic and specialized methods SHALL handle errors consistently
4. WHEN I switch backends (AirTable, Baserow, etc.) THEN both generic and specialized methods SHALL work with the new backend

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for the network schema methods, so that I can handle edge cases and failures when reading from inventory backends gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network schema method encounters a backend error THEN the system SHALL raise an appropriate exception with clear error messaging
2. WHEN invalid parameters are passed to network schema methods THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and raise descriptive errors
3. WHEN a method requests non-existent tables or data from the inventory backend THEN the system SHALL return empty results or None as appropriate rather than raising exceptions
4. WHEN inventory backend connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the connection issue

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer synchronizing data, I want the network schema methods to handle data transformation and validation, so that inventory backend data is properly formatted for database insertion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network schema methods retrieve data from inventory backends THEN the system SHALL validate that required fields are present
2. WHEN data types in the inventory backend don't match database schema expectations THEN the system SHALL attempt appropriate type conversions
3. WHEN inventory backend data contains extra fields not in the database schema THEN the system SHALL include them in extra_data fields where available
4. WHEN inventory backend data is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL raise clear validation errors indicating which fields are missing
